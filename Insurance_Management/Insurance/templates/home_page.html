        <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;">AMS is software for insurance agents. It's designed to automate the majority of administrative and logistical concerns so that agents can save time on organization and filing. When agents can manage their day-to-day paperwork more effectively, it allows them to spend more time on clients. A good AMS streamlines and simplifies the storing of customer history and financial details so that all members of the agency have instant access to the information they need. </h4>

        <h4 style="padding: 50px 50px 20px;">It’s impossible to know if you’re following crucial policies when your information isn’t organized, and the consequences can be costly. Insurance management systems are vital to <strong style="color: rgb(236, 236, 116);">maintaining insurance agency compliance</strong> in agencies of all sizes. Meticulous record-keeping and automated alerts ensure you are aligned with local and federal regulations.</h4>
        <h4 style="padding:50px 50px ;"><strong style="color: rgb(236, 236, 116);">Insurance industry regulations </strong>are dictated state-by-state through individual state insurance departments which classify insurance regulation as a public interest activity. These state regulations allow insurance providers to make more specialized decisions on behalf of local clients but can cause problems when agencies expand to multiple states. Using an AMS allows you to classify clients by location and ensures your agency is following appropriate protocols.</h4>
